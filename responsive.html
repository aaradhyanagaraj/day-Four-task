                <span style="font-size: larger; color: blueviolet;"> GitHub Copilot</span> was the first of the
                Microsoft
                Copilot technologies to hit the market and has since seen great
                success in the world of AI-driven coding and development. The tool is capable of transforming natural
                language
                prompts into code recommendations for all languages in public repositories. For languages like
                JavaScript
                that
                are widely used, GitHub Copilot is able to generate a wide range and quantity of coding suggestions.<br>

                <span style="font-size: larger; color: blueviolet;"> AI21 Studio </span> a generative AI solution from
                AI21 Labs
                that gives developers APIs to develop and customize
                Jurassic-2 and task-specific models. Its pre-existing task models focus primarily on reading and writing
                taskwork, with the Wordtune API family of task models leading the way. <br>
    
                Many developers choose to work with this tool because of its enterprise-ready APIs that are easy to spin
                up and
                integrate with common tech stacks and IDEs. AI21 Studio also offers a flexible range of solutions
                depending on
                whether you want to start with a foundation model and fine-tune it, or you choose to build your own apps
                with
                Studio’s foundational task models. A large number of users choose to work with task-specific models that
                require
                no prompt engineering or fine-tuning to scale. <br>

                AlphaCode 2</span> by Google’s DeepMind is one of the
                foremost problem-solving and coding solutions in the generative
                AI space, though it is not publicly available. Compared to the original AlphaCode, which included 41.4
                billion
                parameters and bested the performance of median-level human competitors in Codeforces competitions, the
                new
                AlphaCode is estimated to have performed in the 85th percentile in Codeforces competitions. According to
                the
                AlphaCode team, AlphaCode 2 was able to solve 1.7 times more problems than the original iteration, with
                the help
                of a “bespoke search and reranking mechanism.” <br>
